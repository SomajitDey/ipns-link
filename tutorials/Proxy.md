### Aim

Expose an https site, e.g. `www.google.com`, with `ipns-link`. 

### Steps

#### Prelude

Install, initialize and launch daemon steps can be followed from the [Quick Start](/tutorials/QuickStart.md) tutorial.

#### Generate key

Let's now generate the IPNS-key the would later expose our server. Because the key is hard to remember, we must give it a human-friendly name, e.g. `google`.

```bash
ipns-link gen google
```

#### Expose the site

There are two ways to do this:

1. Edit the config specific to the key named `google` with 

   ```bash
   ipns-link config google
   ```

   and put `local.endpoint: "https://www.google.com"`. Then, expose `google` simply as 

   ```bash
   ipns-link expose google
   ```

2. Or, you can simply do

   ```bash
   ipns-link expose google https://www.google.com
   ```

If everything goes alright, https://www.google.com should be accessible using any IPNS-Link-Gateway within a few minutes. Try the BaseURL at any browser.

#### Postlude

Monitor, hide and shutdown steps can be followed from the [Quick Start](/tutorials/QuickStart.md) tutorial.
